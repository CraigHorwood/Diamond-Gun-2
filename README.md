# Diamond-Gun-2
Released exactly one year after the first Diamond Gun, Diamond Gun 2 is a sequel that is longer, larger, with more depth, more polish, more collectibles, a more tenacious grasp on its game design, and is, just as importantly, far more challenging. I developed this game for half a year, and as of January of 2018, I still consider it my best work due to how much of an overall solid game it is. The code could certainly be improved in some areas, and already has been in the C++ remaster Diamond Gun Collection, but I hold the original Java build in somewhat higher esteem. Also worth noting is that some of the music tracks in this game are taken from other games, and while original tracks do exist, I can't be bothered converting them to .ogg format yet.
